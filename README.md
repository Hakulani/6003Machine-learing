# What is Streamlit?
https://docs.streamlit.io/
Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers.

# installation 
pip install streamlit

# How to run
Streamlit is more than just a way to make data apps, it’s also a community of creators that share their apps and ideas and help each other make their work better. Please come join us on the community forum. We love to hear your questions, ideas, and help you work through your bugs — stop by today!

The first step is to create a new Python script. Let's call it uber_pickups.py.

Open uber_pickups.py in your favorite IDE or text editor, then add these lines:
```

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Every good app has a title, so let's add one:
```

st.title('Uber pickups in NYC')
```

Now it's time to run Streamlit from the command line:
```
streamlit run uber_pickups.py
```
