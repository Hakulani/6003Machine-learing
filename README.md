# What is Streamlit?
https://docs.streamlit.io/
Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers.

# installation 
pip install streamlit
pip install - r requirements.txt
# How to run
Streamlit is more than just a way to make data apps, itâ€™s also a community of creators that share their apps and ideas and help each other make their work better.
```
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Every good app has a title, so let's add one:
```
st.title('KNN')
```

Now it's time to run Streamlit from the command line:
```
streamlit run knn.py
```
